## Installation
Create a bin folder in your Home directory. 
If you already have a bin folder, you can use it or you can make another folder with a different name.
```bash 
mkdir ~/bin
```

Change directory into the bin folder that was just created. 
```bash 
cd ~/bin
```

Downloads the script.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezlosbb/Make-HTML-Script.git
```

## Usage 
mksite.sh <new-folder-name>

All you have to do is run the script and it will create a folder within your home directory with the necesities to make a simple website with html and css.

Created Files:
1. Sites folder in your Desktop directory
1. <folder-name> containing files
1. index.html
1. images folder to store images
1. style folder for your css
1. style.css to write css

I'll try to update it as soon as I understand more about web development. Enjoy!
