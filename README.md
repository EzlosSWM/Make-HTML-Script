## Installation
___
git clone https://github.com/ezlosbb/Make-HTML-Script.git

## Usage 

All you have to do is run ./makesite.sh and it will create a folder with the necesities to make a simple website with html and css.

I'll try to update it as soon as I understand more about web development. Enjoy!
